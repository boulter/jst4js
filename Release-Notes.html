    <h1>Release Notes</h1>

    <h3>Release 1.3</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Added the Template.scripts() and Template.styles() methods for
            allowing partials to add dependencies on CSS and client Javascript
            paths for HTML templates.
        </li>
        <li>
            Updated the Shell so it removes the bottom Text box, and behaves more
            like a shell you'd expect to see.
        </li>
        <li>
            Refactored Template.collectContentFor() to handle multiple calls to
            collectContentFor() the resulting function will concatenate them
            together.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Release 1.2</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Added support for treating instances of java.util.* as native Javascript types.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added support for templates to declare the input parameters to their template.  It
            simplifies all Templates both the top level template and partials you might call
            so they all behave the same way.  All templates have formal parameters just like
            functions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Also allow for layout definitions to be included within the template itself.
        </li>
        <li>
            Updated Emailer to have support for specifying the username and password in
            spring configuration directly instead of through javamail properties.
        </li>
    </ul>
